  textEn: `Perfect love came to the world, to call His sons and daughters home, He left his peace and peace came to stay
  Comforter, sweet joy of mine, faithful as the winter pine, the purest light my heart will ever know
  Perfect love is coming down to greet us in our darkness, with compassion and a heartbeat in his hand
  Thorns have grown where roses belong, so you came singing a gardener’s song – beauty for ashes and life where there is none
  Jesus, light of the world, You’ve had mercy on us, and given us peace
  Jesus, face of the Father, You have come to show us home, and give us the key
  The captive has a home in You, the broken have a healer too, the weary have a place where they can rest
  Hopelessness can’t make a sound, when this kind of love comes around, Jesus, you have come to make a way`,

  textAr: `اتانا بحبهِ  دعانا لملكهِ وترك لنا سلامهُ
  مريحي وفرحتي عزائي في وحدتي نوري وخلاصي سيدي
  النور اتى للظلمةِ ليدعونا لمجدهِ بحبٍ وحنانٍ من قلبهِ
  اقامني من كسرتي رفعني من ظلمتي حررني من كلِ قيدِ
  يسوع نورُ العالم اتيت لترحمنا وتعطينا السلام
  يسوع بهاء مجد الاب اتيت لتنقذنا وتغفر الاثام
  تطلق كل مأسور وتجبر القلب المكسور قربك مكان راحتي
  لا لروح الفشلِ فحبك لي املي اتيت لتصنعَ طريق
